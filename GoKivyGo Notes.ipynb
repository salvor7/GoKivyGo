    "- Had a while trying to figure out how to make the GridLayout fit the image in particular rather than the entire entry of the parent BoxLayout\n",
    "    - The image itself keeps its square regardless of how the screen is resized, we need Buttons to follow that\n",
    "    - turned out that the trick was using Image's [norm_image_size](https://kivy.org/docs/api-kivy.uix.image.html?highlight=image#kivy.uix.image.Image.norm_image_size) to get the size of the image, no matter how it was resized\n",
    "    - Once we had this, the image was the right size, but not in the right position. We noticed that what we wanted from the position was to be in the middle of the frame, and Kjell immediately informed us that `pos_hint: 0.5, 0.5` was the magic we were looking for\n",
